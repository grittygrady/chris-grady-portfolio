### Web Developer

## Passions

- CSS. It's swept under the rug or abstracted behind a styling framework, but there's so many amazing things it's capable of, and so many interesting functions that are so obscure they feel like finding a hidden treasure.

- React. It's modular functionality, combined with `create-react-app`, allows you to spin up an idea so quickly it makes it tempting to make even the most simple of sites using it. The community is also excellent, so there is no shortage of educational materials. After `jQuery` React was a bit abstract at first but once understood, became a delight to work with due in no small part to the ability to implement the `DRY` principle in both logic and presentation.

- [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/). The only fault here is the multitude of rabbit holes to fall in here. But boy oh boy, you can feel like a kid in a candy store.

# Projects

## Movie vs Movie

A site that helps users decide between two movies. Several questions are asked regarding duration, MPAA rating, and critic scores, and each movie is "scored" accordingly, determining a winner.

## ComiCombat

The age old conundrum - who would win in a fight, Wolverine or Yoda? Nerds everywhere, rejoice! Using hero ability statistics fetched from the Superhero API this site will definitively end these soul consuming arguments.

## Real Websites for Fake People

Sites to demonstrate educational endeavors and improve skills. Some are for real people, some are for fictional businesses and people. Bonus points if you know who Remy LeBeau is.
