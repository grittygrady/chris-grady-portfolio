### Web Developer

## Passions

- CSS. It's swept under the rug or abstracted behind a styling framework, but there's so many amazing things it's capable of, and so many interesting functions that are so obscure they feel like finding a hidden treasure.

- React. It's modular functionality, combined with `create-react-app`, allows you to spin up an idea so quickly it makes it tempting to make even the most simple of sites using it. The community is also excellent, so there is no shortage of educational materials. After `jQuery` React was a bit abstract at first but once understood, became a delight to work with due in no small part to the ability to implement the `DRY` principle in both logic and presentation.

- [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/) The only fault here is the multitude of rabbit holes to fall in here. But boy oh boy, you can feel like a kid in a candy store.
